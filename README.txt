The website tells you a joke (in audio format) when you press the button.

The API key necessary for TTS (text-to-speech) API was left blank due to security reasons. You can get your API from https://www.voicerss.org//api/ (Note: You need to create an account and activate it via email to get an API key.) Once an API key is acquired, the user can paste the API key [as the 'key:' under the tellMe() function declaration in script.js].

(This program was inspired by the joke teller website by Andrei Neagoie.)
